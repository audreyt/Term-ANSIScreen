This is the README file for Term::ANSIScreen, a Term::ANSIColor clone
with supports for screen mode, cursor control and keyboard mapping
sequences.

The author (Autrijus Tang) is aware that the additional features are
largely superseded by Win32::Console and Curse-based modules, but
decides to write this for the poor souls still using ANSI.SYS on
DOSish platforms.

* Installation

Term::ANSIScreen uses the standard perl module install process:

cpansign -v		# see the SIGNATURE file for details
perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install
