* Added functions equivalant of Term::ANSIColor 1.04.

* $ENV{ANSI_COLOR_DISABLED} and uncolor() are supported.

* Added setscroll(), contributed by Cory Johns.

* Exceptions are now handled by croak() instead of die().

* Documented the Win32::Console emulation mode.
  It now does not take a ($flag) anymore -- on Win32 it will
  always spawn a Win32::Console object instead and the
  constructor arguments are passed to that module verbatim.

* Numerous test fixes.

* Massive style changes.  No functional difference.

[Changes for 1.20 - 2001-02-01]

* Added the functionality to double as Win32::Console
  object; simply pass a Term::ANSIScreen->new($flag)
  to create it. If $flag is true and the OS is Win32,
  it will spawn an Win32::Console object instead.
